# sdl_lib

Very simple SDL-based lib that has sprite-renderer; transform (rotation, scale); sprite-animations (based on sprite-sheets or several different sprites); collision checking (on enter, stay and exit); text drawing (with PIVOTs, max size, resize height, reisize freely), and buttons; input system with keyboard and mouse buttons (down, pressed, released), mouse movement (delta, position) and scroll; It also has sound (both sound effect and music), with audio-source and audio-listener, both with spatial positioning and volume-settings, loopin and fades.

There's a pong-game example on the folder.
