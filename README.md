# sdl_lib

Very simple SDL-based lib that has sprite-renderer; transform; sprite-animations (based on sprite-sheets or several different sprites); collision checking (on enter, stay and exit); text drawing (with PIVOTs, max size, resize height, reisize freely), and buttons; It also has sound (both sound effect and music), with audio-source and audio-listener, both with spatial positioning and volume-settings.

There's a pong-game example on the folder.
